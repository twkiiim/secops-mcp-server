    - **Alert Triage:** When an alert is generated by a rule, use this tool to retrieve all historical detections for that rule to understand the context and frequency.
    - **Rule Effectiveness Analysis:** Analyze the volume, timestamps, and details of detections to determine if a rule is too noisy, too quiet, or performing as expected.
    - **Threat Hunting:** If a rule is designed to detect a specific TTP or indicator, use this tool to find all instances where the rule has matched historical data.
    - **Incident Scoping:** During an incident, if a particular rule is relevant, retrieve its detections to help identify the scope and timeline of related events.
    - **Compliance Reporting:** Gather detections for specific rules related to compliance mandates over a certain period.

    **Use Cases:**
    - Retrieve all detections for a rule ID obtained from a SIEM alert or a case management system.

        - **Enrich Observables:** Extract indicators (IPs, domains, hashes) from the detection details or related UDM events and use threat intelligence tools for enrichment.
        - **Case Management:** If detections reveal significant activity, create or update incidents in a case management or SOAR system.
        - **Rule Tuning:** Based on the nature and volume of detections (e.g., many false positives), consider modifying the rule logic (using a hypothetical `update_rule` tool) or its alerting configuration (using `enable_rule` or similar).
        - **Retro-Hunting:** If the rule was recently updated or if you want to test variations, initiate a new retrohunt (e.g., using `create_retrohunt`).
        - **Error Checking:** If detections are missing or behavior is unexpected, check for rule execution errors (e.g., using `list_errors`).
        - **Visualize Detections:** Export detection data and use data visualization tools to identify trends or patterns over time.

    """Test a detection rule against historical data in Chronicle SIEM.

    Tests a YARA-L 2.0 detection rule against historical data to validate its effectiveness
    and tune its parameters before deployment. This is essential for ensuring rules work
    as expected and generate appropriate alerts without excessive false positives.



    **Workflow Integration:**
    - Critical testing step before creating or modifying detection rules in production.
    - Use during rule development to iteratively refine detection logic and thresholds.
    - Essential for validating rule effectiveness against real historical data.
    - Helps optimize rule performance and reduce false positive rates.

    **Use Cases:**
    - Test new rule logic against historical data to validate detection accuracy.
    - Tune rule thresholds and conditions based on historical event patterns.
    - Validate rule modifications before deploying changes to production.
    - Assess rule performance impact by measuring detection volume and processing time.
    - Compare different rule variations to determine the most effective detection approach.

    **Rule Testing Best Practices:**
    - Test against a representative time period that includes both normal and suspicious activity.
    - Review detected events to ensure they align with your intended detection objectives.
    - Adjust rule conditions based on test results to optimize precision and recall.
    - Consider the rule's computational complexity and potential impact on Chronicle performance.
    - Test with different time windows to understand detection patterns and false positive rates.

    Args:
        rule_text (str): Complete YARA-L 2.0 rule definition to test.
        project_id (str): Google Cloud project ID (required).
        customer_id (str): Chronicle customer ID (required).
        region (str): Chronicle region (e.g., "us", "europe") (required).
        hours_back (int): How many hours of historical data to test against. Defaults to 168 (7 days).
        max_results (int): Maximum number of detection results to return. Defaults to 100.

    Returns:
        str: Formatted test results showing detection count, sample detections, and analysis summary.
             Returns error message if testing fails.

    Next Steps (using MCP-enabled tools):
        - Analyze the test results to determine if the rule meets your detection objectives.
        - Refine the rule based on the test results and retest as needed.
        - Create the rule using `create_rule` once testing shows satisfactory results.
        - Enable the rule using `enable_rule` to start generating production alerts.
        - Monitor the rule's ongoing performance using alert management tools.

    """Validate a YARA-L 2.0 detection rule syntax in Chronicle SIEM.

    Validates the syntax and structure of a YARA-L 2.0 detection rule without creating
    or testing it. This is useful for checking rule syntax during development and
    identifying compilation errors before rule deployment.



    **Workflow Integration:**
    - Use during rule development to quickly validate syntax without full testing.
    - Essential for catching syntax errors early in the rule development process.
    - Helpful for validating rule modifications before testing against historical data.
    - Enables rapid iteration on rule development with immediate syntax feedback.

    **Use Cases:**
    - Validate rule syntax during initial development or modification.
    - Check for compilation errors before committing rule changes.
    - Quickly verify that complex rule logic is syntactically correct.
    - Validate imported or shared rules before integration into your environment.
    - Educational tool for learning YARA-L 2.0 syntax and best practices.

    **Validation Capabilities:**
    - Syntax validation for YARA-L 2.0 language constructs
    - Field name validation against Chronicle's UDM schema
    - Function and operator usage validation
    - Rule structure and format validation
    - Metadata section validation
